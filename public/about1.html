<h1>About Alison Shepard</h1>
<p>I've been involved in Health, Safety & Environmental management for over 20 years and its time for a change. </p>

<p>Between console gaming as a hobby, and technology I've interacted with at work (creating training videos, observing colleagues work with drones or developing training using VR), 
  I've been keen to upskill in IT and to pursue a new career path in IT.</p>

<p>After completing a Graduate Diploma in Information Sciences, I've since embarked on learning more "hands on" skills such as web development and learning about cyber security.</p>
